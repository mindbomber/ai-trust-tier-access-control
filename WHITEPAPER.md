# AI Trust Tier Framework ‚Äì White Paper

## Executive Summary

As AI capabilities rapidly evolve, so do the risks of misuse. From bioweapon synthesis to political disinformation, the barrier to dangerous outcomes is lower than ever. This paper introduces the AI Trust Tier Framework: a dynamic, risk-based access control system that profiles users and gates access to high-risk AI functionality.

## Problem

There is no scalable system that limits access to sensitive AI capabilities based on user intent or trustworthiness. Anyone with an API key or open-source model can cause real-world harm.

## The Framework

- **User Trust Profiling**  
  - Verifies identity, behavior, reputation, and usage history
  - Outputs a trust score and access tier

- **Prompt Risk Classification**  
  - Real-time risk tagging (e.g. ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù ‚Äúsensitive,‚Äù ‚Äúprohibited‚Äù)

- **Tiered Access Gateway**  
  - Enforces access rules based on user tier and prompt risk level

## Implementation Roadmap

1. MVP Pilot
2. Integration with open LLM APIs
3. Partner with AI safety coalitions and policymakers

## Conclusion

We don‚Äôt let anyone walk into a government archive‚Äîwhy should AI be any different? This framework offers a path to scalable, ethical, and secure AI deployment.
