# AI Trust Tier Access Control

**The Security Clearance Layer for AI**

AI is becoming powerfulâ€”and dangerous in the wrong hands. This project introduces a framework for dynamic, risk-based access control to AI capabilities. Think of it like security clearance for AI users.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Profiles users based on identity, behavior, and history
- Assigns real-time trust scores and tiers
- Analyzes prompts for risk level
- Gates access to AI functionality accordingly (allow, deny, escalate)

## ðŸ”§ Components

- **Trust Scoring Engine** (API)
- **Access Gateway** (middleware)
- **Prompt Risk Classifier**
- **User Dashboard** (trust score, appeals)
- **Admin Console** (audit + override)

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

To prevent misuse of advanced AI while allowing responsible users to innovate safely. Especially critical for:
- Open-source LLMs
- Enterprise AI deployments
- Government/critical systems
